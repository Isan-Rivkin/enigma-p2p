/** Discovery sequence **/

This part describes the initial discovery process of a new Worker in the network. 
The network refers to the local node and peers are remote Workers. 
The discovery sequence seperates between 2 parts: 
New Worker in the network - don't have peers info in the persistent storage. 
Previously logged Worker - Have some stored peers info. 
All the messages are in JSONRPC 2.0 format 

New Worker in the network: 
The worker has hardcoded addresses of bootstraping nodes and they would be 
the first connection to the network. Their goal is to be a gateway to
the network and returns DNS Seeds. Incase they are offline the Worker could
find other workers IP's on the internet and add them manualy using the CLI. 

msg #1 Worker to a boostrap node - ping 

// id : The Server MUST reply with the same value in the Response object if included. This member is used to correlate the context between the two objects.
// An identifier established by the Client that MUST contain a value  

// node_id : a param holding base58 of the nodes public key (PeerInfo)

// signature : hash(nonce || node_id) 
// the signature is used for distinction between messages and veryfing nodes ID.

// findpeers : boolean indicating if a peer list should be returned 

// ? Possibly the Ethereum signing key 

{
	"jsonrpc" : "2.0",
	"method" : "ping",
	"params" : [{"node_id":"","nonce" : "", "signature" : "", "findpeers" : ""}],
	"id" : "", 
}

msg #2 Boostrap node to the Worker  

// the response object : 

// status : 200 ok, otherwise error 

// nonce : new generated nonce 

// seeds : list of PeerInfo 

// signature : hash(nonce || require_signature || request_nonce)

// seeds : list of A DNS records (potential peers)

// the request object - the ping message : 

// node_id : the requester_id 
// nonce : the ping request nonce 
// signature : the signature that was passed or it's hash. 
{
	"jsonrpc" : "2.0",
	"method" : "pong",
	"params" : [{"response":{"status":"", "nonce":"","seeds" : [], "signature" : ""},
		"request" : {"node_id":"","nonce" : "", "signature" : ""}}],
	"id" : "", 
}

// handshaking with A DNS seed 
// At that point the Worker starts to look for peers activley 
// repeating the same concept of ping-pong messages 

* Synchronize sequence *

This sequence describes on how a new Worker gets in sync with the network state 
it does not aim to describe state-transitions of the network which will happen every epoch
and will be described later at a sequence called 'Passing the torch'
The sync process will refer to epoch number as the logical sequence of time. 
Same as block number in a blockchain. 
The Worker's goal is to be in sync till the current epoch state. 

The synchronization of secret-contracts will include:
1) Contract code
2) initial payload (delta 0)
3) all state changes (deltas)

// Enigma smart contract stores in some way or another: 
+--------------------+----------------+-----------+---------+------+
| secret-contracts   | deployed code  | delta 1   | delta 2 | ...  |
| address            | + payload hash | delta 1   | delta 2 | ...  |
+--------------------+----------------+-----------+---------+------+
| 0x01...            | asd..          | h(d1)     | h(d2)   | ...  |
